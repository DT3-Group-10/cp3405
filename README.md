## 3 Artifacts 
### product backlogs
(See )
User stories (list of features that could potentially go into the product) 
    >>> user stories would be formatted such as " As a _____ I need ______ so that ________" 
### sprint backlogs

### burndown chart

### 3 Ceremonies
- **Sprint planning**: product owner, scrum master and team meets to discuss the user stories 
- **Daily stand-up**: stand up meeting where we discuss what we did since the last meeting 
    - did: i did - ___________ 
    - do: ill do this - ________________
    - obstacle: difficulties or help needed - ________________
- **Sprint review**: whole team meet up and demonstrates the product while discussing what could be done better


## TODO:
1. the product backlog, 
product owner builds a list of ideas and features that could go into the product 

2. sprint planning 
the list of ideas and features is discussed with everyone to narrow down what can go into the next sprint (next step)

3. sprint backlog
means that we would take the user stories and ideas that we picked in the previous meeting and pick out the missing pieces to work on during the actual sprint
